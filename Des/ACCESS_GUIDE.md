# 🎯 ACCESS GUIDE - University Attendance System

## ✅ **SERVER IS RUNNING AND WORKING!**

The Django server is now running successfully on port 8000.

---

## 🌐 **HOW TO ACCESS THE APPLICATION**

### **Method 1: Try these URLs in your browser**

**Primary URLs (try these first):**
- `http://localhost:8000/`
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

**Alternative URLs (if primary don't work):**
- `http://172.30.0.2:8000/`
- `http://172.17.0.1:8000/`

### **Method 2: If you're using a container/Docker environment**

If you're running this in a containerized environment, you need to use the container's IP address instead of localhost.

1. **Find your container IP:**
   ```bash
   hostname -I
   ```

2. **Use the IP address shown:**
   - If it shows `172.30.0.2`, use `http://172.30.0.2:8000/`
   - If it shows `172.17.0.1`, use `http://172.17.0.1:8000/`

### **Method 3: Port forwarding (if needed)**

If you're using Docker or a similar container system, you might need to map the port:

```bash
# Example for Docker
docker run -p 8000:8000 your-container
```
